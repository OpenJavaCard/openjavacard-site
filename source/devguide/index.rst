Development Guide
=================

This guide is an attempt at collecting everything you need to get started with JavaCard development.

It will tell you what you need to read, what equipment you might need and whom you might need to talk to.

Be warned that the JavaCard ecosystem is, at present, not an easy one to get into.

You will likely need some experience with Java development and a background in system programming to follow this guide.
