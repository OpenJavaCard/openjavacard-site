AID Naming
----------

Smartcards, including JavaCard ones, use so-called AIDs (application identifiers) to identify code packages, applets and some other objects. These identifiers, commonly represented as hexadecimal strings, are binary strings with a length of between 5 and 16 bytes.

The namespace for these AIDs is specified and maintained by ISO. Assignment happens in the form of 5-byte RIDs (registry identifiers). Registries exist on a national level as well as internationally within ISO. To obtain a registration you will generally have to go through your national registry, which normally should be your national ISO member organization. Various countries have delegated registry duties to other organizations, so it can be hard to find out who is responsible.
