Applications
============

Cryptography
------------

Smartcards have always been used for cryptographic purposes.

The main motivation for using smartcards in cryptographic applications is their ability to contain keys and protect them from outside access.

Traditional cryptography-type applications can be found in PKI and OTP tokens, SIM cards, identity cards, license cards as well as in online and offline banking.

Policy
------

Smartcards are also used to implement policy.

The main motivation for implementing policy using smartcards is the ability of the card to protect state and state transitions from outside manipulation.

Traditional policy-type applications are found in loyalty cards, usage tokens (such as for photocopiers) and also in low-volume payment applications (electronic cash, phone cards, pre-payment systems) that do not rely on cryptography for the payment operation.

Storage
-------

Smartcards can be used to store information.
