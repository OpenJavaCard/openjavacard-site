OpenJavaCard
============

Open-source software and resources for JavaCard development.

We want to make JavaCard development easier, more attractive and more approachable for everyone.

What?
-----

`JavaCard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCard>`_ is a set of standards and technologies for developing `applets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applet>`_ that run on `smart cards <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_cards>`_. It is used in devices such as credit and debit cards, SIM cards and other security tokens. You can also buy blank programmable cards and tokens that you can program yourself, which is what this project is about.

Our main goal is to provide a consistent :doc:`development toolchain <projects/tools>` for JavaCard applets and :doc:`libraries <projects/libraries>` based on open-source code written by ourselves and others, and we are also building a set of libraries that should make JavaCard development a little easier.

Why?
----

Running your own code on smart cards allows you to implement your own high-security applications. Authenticate users and customers. Share information privately and with integrity. Build security and trust. Enable privacy for yourself and others.

We want to do things such as these, and to do that we want to use open tools. To this end we want to add to the great work of others in the open-source community by providing more tools, more information and more resources.

Who?
----

We are a group of smart card professionals and interested hackers. Anyone may contribute to the project. All our work will be public and free. We will also gladly support research and academic projects as our resources permit.

This project is an open-source project in the classical sense of the word. Project leadership is currently by benevolent dictatorship with an abundance of good intentions and little time for squabbles.
