General Information
===================

This project is an open-source project run by volunteers with the stated goal of making JavaCard more approachable and easier to develop for. The JavaCard platform has been an open platform for many years, but the barrier of entry remains significant. We want to change this by helping to improve the ecosystem for open development and applications.
