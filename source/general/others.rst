Other Projects
==============

We are, of course, not the only JavaCard project out there.

This project would never have begun without the previous work of others, who have pioneered both in releasing a lot of the required information and in publishing open source software related to JavaCard development.

JavaCardPro
-----------

Being the project of Martin Paljak, `JavaCardPro <https://javacard.pro/>`_ provides the de-facto standard toolchain for open-source JavaCard development.

Very importantly, their `GlobalPlatformPro <https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro>`_ is the current go-to solution for programming JavaCard targets via the GlobalPlatform card protocol. While we offer our own tools for this purpose we still appreciate the availability of this alternative.

The project also provides the invaluable `ant-javacard <https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard>`_, which is the simplest and smallest build system for JavaCard. This is a good alternative to use in air-gaps and other restricted/secure environments.

JCAlgTest
---------

Created by Petr Svenda, the `JCAlgTest database <https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcalgtest/>`_ contains information about most JavaCard devices that are commonly available.

The list contains everything from memory sizes to supported cryptographic algorithms and performance data, which will help you with your buying decisions and also is a good market overview.

Please consider submitting test results from your cards to this project!

jCardSim
--------

Being the standard open-source JavaCard simulator, `jCardSim <https://github.com/licel/jcardsim>`_ is a project by the Java technology company `Licel <https://licelusa.com/>`_.

It emulates a JavaCard environment in a J2SE context, allowing its use for purposes such as development and automated testing.

If you want to implement tests - which you should - then you will want this.
