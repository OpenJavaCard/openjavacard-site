Other Projects
==============

We are, of course, not the only JavaCard project out there.

This project would never have begun without the previous work of others, who have pioneered both in releasing a lot of the required information and in publishing open source software related to JavaCard development.

JavaCardPro
-----------

Being the project of Martin Paljak, `JavaCardPro <https://javacard.pro/>`_ provides the de-facto standard toolchain for open-source JavaCard development.

This project provides the invaluable `ant-javacard <https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard>`_, which is the simplest and smallest build system for JavaCard.

JCAlgTest
---------

Created by Petr Svenda, the `JCAlgTest database <https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcalgtest/>`_ contains information about most JavaCard devices that are commonly available.

The list contains everything from memory sizes to supported cryptographic algorithms.

jCardSim
--------

Being the standard open-source JavaCard simulator, `jCardSim <https://github.com/licel/jcardsim>`_ is a project by the Java technology company `Licel <https://licelusa.com/>`_.
