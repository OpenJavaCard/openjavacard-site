OJC NDEF
========

OpenJavaCard NDEF ist a JavaCard implementation of an NDEF type 4 tag. It can be installed on a JavaCard, allowing that card to function as an NFC tag in conjunction with smartphones and other NDEF readers.

This allows the sending of URLs - either static or generated - to phones for easy user interaction. Other data types can also be carried, allowing the presentation of vCard/vCal records and other small-size media files.

You can find more information on the `GitHub project page <https://github.com/OpenJavaCard/openjavacard-ndef>`_.
