Tools
=====

OpenJavaCard Tools is a toolkit for JavaCard development that provides a GlobalPlatform client and various debugging aids, all based on clean-room library code that has been designed with reuse in mind.

With this project we want to provide a solid one-stop toolkit for JavaCard development and enable others to improve development support by implementing IDE support, build system plugins and provisioning systems.
