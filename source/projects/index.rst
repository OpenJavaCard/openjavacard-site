We want to work with you to build better JavaCard tools and applications!

You can participate through our `GitHub organization <https://github.com/OpenJavaCard/>`_, which is linked to our `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/OpenJavaCard/>`_.

Our main project are our :doc:`tools <tools>`, which mostly cover card management at the moment.

We also want to provide useful :doc:`libraries <libraries>` for the JavaCard environment.
